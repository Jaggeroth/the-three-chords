<h2>The UK's Only Bluegrass Musical</h2>
<p>
  <b class="first">The Three Chords Theatre Company presents a cacophony of foot-stomping 
  musical numbers in the one and only "Fat Shirley's, A Trailer Park Opera".</b>&nbsp; In the 
  operatic tradition there is grief, love, peril and betrayal, as a trailer park community in 
  America's deep south come to terms with an unexpected death, possible eviction, and marital 
  strife. 
</p>
<p>
  Previously performed in the US and the UK and with sell out shows in Bristol, Fat Shirley 
  has developed something of a cult following: the Rocky Horror Show of the bluegrass scene, with 
  audience members often turning up in costume.
