<h2>Bob Pepper</h2>

  <b class="first">As a Chartered Architect, Bob spent his career working in 
  the public sector, including twenty years in the NHS developing new 
  hospitals.</b>  He now devotes his time working pro bono for the Bristol 
  Folk House Charity and for the Prince's Trust as a young person mentor.  
  Bob took up the mandolin when he moved to Bristol ten years ago and joined 
  the Bristol Mandolin and Guitar Ensemble where he first learned to read 
  music.  Playing with Hogranch, the bluegrass and americana band, has taken 
  him to festivals around the UK, the Netherlands and the USA as well as the
