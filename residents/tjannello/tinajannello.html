<h2>Tina Jannello</h2>
<p>
  <b class="first">Tina is the only American in the Fat Shirley Family although a 
  northerner!</b> She was born in New York and trained in NYC at the Centre for 
  Media Arts in speech and broadcasting. It was while in Bristol she explored her 
  love for theatre performance. After acting and working behind the scenes with 
  local theatre companies she joined forces with a talented group of musicians and 
  actors to create The Three Chords Theatre Company. Fat Shirley is very close to 
  her heart, having been a part of "the trailer park family" from the beginning and 
  hopes you enjoy it as much as she does.</p>
